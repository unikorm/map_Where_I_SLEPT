# Map where I slept

this is my favorite project i create and is in progress, I do it with React and for now plain CSS, with JS, not TS, 
I already learned and learning by now A LOT here about React and his stuff how make web app works pretty well


## In progress

here is a lot to do, styling is one thing, but refactoring codebase after I learnd something new, adding new features and logic, I often get overhelmed with it, but what is best is cut the whole thing in small pieces and make it happen


### API  

I trying practise here with working with different APIs like map or weather, I want put here more and try fun stuff
